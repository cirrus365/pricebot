Nifty is designed with privacy in mind:                                         

 • Works in standard Matrix rooms (unencrypted)                                 
 • For E2EE support, additional setup with matrix-nio encryption dependencies is
   required                                                                     
 • Doesn't log personal data beyond conversation context                        
 • Open-source and self-hostable                                                
 • Respects user privacy preferences                                            
 • Price data is cached locally to minimize API calls                           

Note: This bot currently does not support end-to-end encrypted rooms out of the 
box. To enable E2EE support, you would need to install additional dependencies  
and configure the matrix-nio E2EE plugin.
